Given relation \(R\) on a set, then we say the \(R\) is a partial
ordered relation is \(R\) is \emph{reflexive},
\emph{antisymmetric}\footnote{\(R\) is \emph{antisymmetric} if
  \(\forall \; a,b \in A: (a,b), (b,a) \in R \implies  a=b\)}, and
  \emph{transitive}. In this case we say that \(A\) is a \emph{partial
ordered set}.

\begin{definition}
Partial ordered relation exists for all
\(\forall \: x,y \in R \;\exists\; (x,y) \in R\) or \((y,x) \in R\) is
called a \emph{linear order}.
\end{definition}

Suppose that \(R\) is a partial ordered relation on \(A\):

\[(a,b) \in R \quad a \leq_R b\]

\(x \in A\) is called the \emph{maximum} if \(\forall \; y \in A\) , if
\((x,y) \in R\), then \(x=y\). (\(x\) has no arrows going out of it
except for to itself).

\(x \in A\) is called the \emph{minimum} if \(\forall \; y \in A\) , if
\((y,x) \in R\), then \(x=y\). (\(x\) has no arrows going to it except
for to itself).

\section{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse_diagram}{Hasse
Diagram}}

We'll say that pair \((x,y) \in R\) is ``required'' in a Hasse diagram
if \(x \neq y\), and therefore:

\[\forall z \in A (x,z),(z,y) \in R \implies z=x \text{ or } z=y\]

Essentially, we can get rid of all arrows that represent transitivity and
reflexivity because they are assumed.

\begin{claim}
If \(R\) is a linear ordered relation on \(A\) then there exists in
\(A\) only one maximum and minimum.
\end{claim}
