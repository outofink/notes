For all matrices, there exists a singular *canonical matrix* which is
equivelent to matrix $A$, symbolized as $U_A$.

The *rank* of a matrix is equal to the number of *free variables* in a
matrix.

A *dependent variable* is dependent values in the matrix.

Let $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\{\vec v_1,\vec v_2, \ldots, \vec v_k\}$ is a
finite group of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^m$.

$sp(S)$ as the group of all linear combinations of the vectors $S$:

$$sp(S) = \left\{\lambda_1 \vec v_1 + \lambda_2 \vec v_2 + \ldots + \lambda_k
\vec v_k \mid \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_k \in \mathbb{R} \right\}$$

This is known as its *span*.
