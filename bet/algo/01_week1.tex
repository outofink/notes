\section{What's is an Algorithm?}
An \textit{algorithm} is a formal description of an effective method of solving
a well-defined set of problems, while using limited resources (namely, time and
space).

Specifically, an algorithm matches any possible input to an output that solves a
given problem for that input.

Most of the problems that we will be focusing on are combinitorical
optimization, where the input is defined as a large finite set of potential
solutions and we have to select the minimal (or maximal) solution.

We will focus on asymptotic efficiency of the algorithm, as a function of the
size of the input.

\section{History}
One of the first descriptions of algorithms was found in ancient Babylonia. In
ancient Greece \textit{Euclid's Algorithm}, \textit{Sieve of Eratosthenes}, and
the \textit{Babylonian Square-Root Method}, were created from the third century
BCE until the first century CE.

The \textit{Hindu-Arabic numeral system} was developed by Indian mathematician
between the first and fourth centuries and was later adapted by Arabic
mathematicians by the ninth century. Most notably the digit $0$ was first used
by the turn of the seventh century by Brahmagupta.

Although first found to be used in the first century in China, \textit{Gauss'
Elimination Method} was monumental development for algorithmically solving
matrices.

In 1928, Hilbert and Ackermann proposed the \textit{Entscheidungsproblem}
(decision problem), which asks if a problem can, by way of an algorithm, can be
answered "Yes" or "No" in according to whether the input, a statement, is
universally valid.
