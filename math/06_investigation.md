# How to investigate a function

1. Define the domain

$m=\lim\limits_{x \to +\infty} \frac{f(x)}{x}$

$n=\lim\limits_{x \to +\infty} f(x)-mx$

A function that is increasing is one that the derivative at that point is
positive.

$$I \subseteq D(f)$$
For all points $a,b \in I$:

$a>b \iff f(a) > f(b)$

A *local minimum* of a function is where the derivative to left is positive,
the right is negative, and the point itself is zero.

A *local maximum* of a function is where the derivative to left is negative,
the right is positive, and the point itself is zero.

$$x \in (I \cap D)\backslash \{a\}$$
